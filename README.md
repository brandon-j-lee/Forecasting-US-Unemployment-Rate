# Forecasting-US-Unemployment-Rate
In this project, we will be examining the U.S. unemployment rates during the past two decades in a time series dataset created by the official U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Our ultimate goal regarding this dataset is to find a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model that is able to successfully forecast future unemployment rates based on the preexisting data that has already been gathered over the years. To accomplish this task, we will split the dataset into a training set and a test set, use transformations and differencing to make our data stationary, conduct ACF/PACF analysis to find candidate models, compare AIC(C) values to identify the “best” model out of the possible candidates, and perform diagnostic checks to determine whether or not the final model is indeed suitable for forecasting use. After employing all of these statistical techniques, we successfully determined a SARIMA model that is able to forecast future U.S. unemployment rates to a satisfactory extent, based on having successful forecasting results on the test set.
